# ❄️ Snowball Package  

Snowball is a centralized, cross-platform package designed to generate **dbt-based code** seamlessly across multiple platforms such as **SQL Server, Snowflake, Databricks, Fabric**, and more.  
Whether the output format is **Spark SQL notebooks** or **plain SQL scripts**, Snowball bundles everything you need—including required libraries and dependencies—to connect with dbt scripts and generate platform-specific code versions.

## 📖 Overview  

`dbt_runner` (part of the Snowball ecosystem) is a **Python-based automation tool** that:  
- Compiles and formats dbt projects.  
- Generates **PySpark notebooks** from compiled SQL files.  
- Packages dbt workflows into a ready-to-distribute archive.  

With Snowball, you can streamline **Analytics, Reporting, and R&D workflows** with minimal manual effort.  

---

## ⚙️ Requirements  

- **Python 3.7+**  
- Required dependencies (installed automatically with pip):  
  - `dbt-core`  
  - `sqlfluff`  
  - `nbformat`  
  - `pyspark`

## 🚀 Setup Instructions  

### 1️⃣ Install the snowball git package using pip install command

Install directly from your organization's private Git repository:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/jmangroup/snowball.git
```

 - This installs the latest snowball_dbt code along with a prebuilt column_mapping.csv in your Downloads folder (used for mapping dimensions).

### 2️⃣ Trigger the main Snowball function by -

```bash
py
import snowball import snowball
snowball.main()
```

### 3️⃣ Configure Column Mapping & DBT Profile

 - Update column_mapping.csv with your required dimensions.
 - Edit your profiles.yml at:
 ```bash
 C:\Users\{UserName}\.dbt\profiles.yml
 ```

 This ensures Snowball connects to your target data platform for the snowball_dbt project.

### 4️⃣ Continue the process , Choose your data platform and your required version
 - Snowball will automatically generate a zipped project folder in your Downloads directory.
